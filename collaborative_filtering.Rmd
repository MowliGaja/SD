### Pros/Cons of collaborative filtering
- Works	for	any	kind	of	item	
- Cold	Start:
  -   Need	enough	users	in	the	system	to	find	a	match	
- Sparsity:		
  -   The	user/ratings	matrix	is	sparse
  -   Hard	to	find	users	that	have	rated	the	same	items
- First	rater:
  -   Cannot	recommend	an	item	that	has	not	been	previously	rated	
  -   New	items,	Esoteric	items
- Popularity	bias:		
  -   Cannot	recommend	items	to	someone	with unique	taste	
  -   Tends	to	recommend	popular	items
