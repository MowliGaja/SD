## Overview
**Main	idea:** Recommend	items	to	customer	x similar	to	previous	items rated	highly	by	x      
**Example:**   

  - Movie	recommendations	     
    - Recommend	movies	with	same	actor(s),director,genre,...

### Plan of Action

## Shallow of Concept

###  item	profile	

- For	each	item,	create	an	item	profile	
- Profile	is	a	set	(vector)	of	features	
    - **Movies:**	author,	-tle,	actor,	director,...
    - **Text:**	Set	of	“important”	words	in	document	
- How	to	pick	important	features?	
  - Usual	heuristic	from	text	mining	is	TF-IDF(Term	frequency	*	Inverse	Doc	Frequency)
    - Term ...	Feature
    - Document...	Item	

### User	profile and Prediction
- **User	profile	possibilities:**
  - Weighted	average	of	rated	item	profiles	
  - **Variation:**	weight	by	difference	from	average	rating	for	item
  - ...
- **Prediction	heuristic:**
  - Given	user	profile	x	and	item	profile	i,	estimate	
  
          
              u(x,i) = cos(x,i)

### Pros: Content-based Approach

+:	No	need	for	data	on	other	users	
+:	Able	to	recommend	to	users	with unique	tastes
+:	Able	to	recommend	new	&	unpopular	items	
+:	Able	to	provide	explanations	

### Cons: Content-based Approach
–:	Finding	the	appropriate	features	is	hard	
–:	Recommenda6ons	for	new	users
–:	Overspecializa6on
